# google-maps-gl-style
A Mapbox GL basemap style designed to look similar to Google Maps; it's a little less busy at some zoom levels.

There's only so close you can get it, given that many roads are designated differently in Open Street Maps vs. Google maps.

If you have a need to get it even closer to the Google Maps look and feel, I'm happy to accept pull requests.
